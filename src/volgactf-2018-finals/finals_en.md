In 2018 we have the following quotas for VolgaCTF 2018 Finals:
- 5 teams from the Volga Federal District of Russia,
- 5 teams from the other regions of Russia,
- 3 foreign teams.

The board may change these quotas on technical grounds. Also, we may invite up to 3 guest teams.

Invitations will be sent to emails specified in teamsâ€™ profiles.
It is crucial that the team eligible for participation in VolgaCTF 2018 Finals confirms its participation by Apr 15.

Please note that a team will be excluded from this list:
- if a team denies taking part in the competition, or does not confirm its participation.
- if a team is unable to cover its travel and accommodation costs (we do not provide financial support),
- if more than the half of members in a team graduated more than 2 years ago.

If a team is excluded from the list, the next one of the same group of teams (according to VolgaCTF 2018 Quals scoreboard) will be invited.
